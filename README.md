# where-do-we-train

This Symfony app has been created to help students know where will be the next sport session. The app calls a weather api to determine wheter or not it is possible to train outside. The app blocks the location of the session 1 day before it beggins so everyone has the same location fore the same sessions even if there a some last minute weather changes. 

To use the app you'll have to launch this command:
```composer install-project```
